## Introduction

* Java is a

  * high level
  
  * robust
  
  * simple
  
  * portable
  
  * secure
  
  * stable
  
  * Object Oriented programming language

* Java is not a pure object-oriented language, because it supports primitive data type.

  > Languages that support or have features which treat everything inside the program as an object, and doesnâ€™t support primitive data type(like int, char, float, boolean)
  
* Java is platform-independent.

  > JRE makes java platform independent. Once your java source code is compiled to byte code/machine independent code, that byte code will run in all devices which has JRE installed.
  
* Java is same as C/C++, so it is easy to learn and write program.

  > Java does not support low-level programming functions like pointers.
  
* Java is all about classes and objects.

* Java is developed by James Ghosling, Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystem Inc.

* Java released its 1st working version in 1991, took 18 month to develop.

* Initially, they named it Oak, then renamed to Java as Oak was already registered for other organisation.

* Usage of Java

  * Desktop Applications
  * Web Applications
  * Mobile Operating System (ex. Android)
  * Embedded System (ex. Digital Electronics, Telecommunications, Computer Netotking, Satellite system)
  * Robotics and Games, etc (ex. manufacturing, assembling and packing, transport, surgery, weaponry, mass production of industrial goods)

* Types of Java Applications
 
  * Standalone Applications
    * Applications that are machine-specific, one can use them directly after installation in local machine.
    * Java developers use AWT, Swing, JavaFX to develop.
    * Examples are Media Players, Antivirus Softwares, System Settings, etc.
  
  * Web Applications
    * An application, that is installed and run in a powerful machine and can be accessed from remote machine by multiple users concurrently using a client application (browsers)
    * Developers around the world are using Servlets, Struts, JSP, Spring, Hibernate, etc.
    * Some realtime examples are Social media websites, -commerce websites, bank applications, etc.
    
  * Enterprise Applications
    * An application that improves productivity and efficiency of an organization.
    * Examples are billing systems, customer relationship management systems and supplier relationship management systems.
  
  * Mobile Application
